lame (3.99.5+repack1-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/patches/force_align_arg_pointer.patch: Enable functions with SSE
    instructions to maintain their own properly aligned stack. Fixes crashes
    with a general protection error when called from the ocaml bindings
    (Closes: #786438). Thanks Detrick Merz for the bug report, Robert Hegemann
    and especially Bernhard Ãœbelacker for their help with analyzing the bug.
  * Remove "experimental optimizations". These are compiler flags that are
    selected on a per-compiler basis, but the latest detected compilers are
    from the gcc-4.x series.
  * Build the frontend with the sndfile io routines, it should be able to read
    RAW PCM and WAV from stdin since at least 3.99.0. As per upstream request.
    + Add Build-Depends: libsndfile1-dev.
  * Append "-Wl,--as-needed -Wl,-z,defs" to LDFLAGS to get rid of the
    unnecessary dependency on libncurses.
  * Change Uploaders field to my <fabian@debian.org> address.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.6.
  * Fix space-in-std-shortname-in-dep5-copyright "BSD (3 clause)" and
    unused-license-paragraph-in-dep5-copyright "GPL-2+" lintian warnings.
  * Update Debian packaging copyright years and address.
  * TODO: Add a lame-dbg package.

    (Closes: #777159).

    -fomit-frame-pointer, and -ffast-math. -fschedule-insns2 is on by default in
    -O2, -fbranch-count-reg is on by default in any mode, and -fforce-addr looks
    to be a noop now. This is with using GCC 4.6.*.
  * Modifiy override_dh_clean target to check if quilt is installed, and use it
    to unapply patches during cleaning.

  * Fix description-synopsis-starts-with-article lintian warnings.

    problematic exclusions to the LGPL and helpful comments about some of the
    files. This needed an update to latest DEP-5 spec.
  * Use dpkg-source unapply-patches option to unapply patches.
  * Add in changes to output of license information from upstream.
  * Update debian/README.source. This includes information what is changed from
    the original upstream source tarball.
  * Update debian/watch to mangle some common version info from the Debian
    version.
